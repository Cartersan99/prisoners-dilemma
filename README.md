# prisoners-dilemma
Simulates the prisoner's dilemma in Python 3. Allows the user to choose their opponent against multiple strategies, or let them fight eachother.
A useful tool for those interested in the topic, and just a fun thing to experiment with. Feel free to fork and add your own strategies or quirks.
